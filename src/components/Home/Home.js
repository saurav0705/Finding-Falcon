                <p>Our Journey is set in the planet of Lengaburu in the distant
                    distant galaxy of Tara B. After the recent war with neighbouring
                    planet Falicornia, King Shan has exiled the Queen of Falicornia
                    for 15 years. </p>

                <p>Queen Al Falcone is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find
                    her before the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15
                    yearsâ€¦.</p>

                <p>
                King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing,
                    Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these
                    planets.
